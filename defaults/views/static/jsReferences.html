  EXAMPLE HTML SCRIPT TAGS INSERT FOR USE WITH PAGEBLOCKS

  This file must exist for PageBlocks to function. If you wish not to use it,
  please remove the content.bodyEnd insert tag from your template views.

  To insert variables into this file, simply add them to the content object of the page 
  and insert them using the JavaScript Template String Notation, as seen below.

  Note, that you do not need to prefix them with "content.".
